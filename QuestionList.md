# 1.Integer Factorization

Integer factorization refers to the mathematical problem of decomposing a given integer into a product of its prime factors. This is a fundamental concept in number theory and has significant applications in various fields such as cryptography, where the security of certain encryption methods relies on the difficulty of integer factorization for large numbers.

For example, the integer 12 can be factored into the product of prime numbers as follows:
12 = 2 × 2 × 3

The goal of integer factorization is to find all the prime numbers that, when multiplied together, yield the original number. Efficient algorithms for integer factorization are crucial for various computational tasks and are an active area of research in theoretical computer science and mathematics.
