The theory of computation tells us that any problem can be turned into a decision problem, thus equating any problem to whether a language can be accepted by a Turing machine. We tried to present some interesting problems, and then present specific transformations for each problem.
Do you think there will be a problem? :)

Question.md list the questions that will be transformed.

Under the Solution directory is the specific transformation scheme of the problem. The filename in this directory corresponds to the issue number. For example, the file corresponding to '1.Integer Factorization' in this directory is 1.md.
